## Obsidian AI plugin

This plugin was developed to make a better way to use Local LLM models with Obsidian.

## In order to use the plugin

```

cd ./obsidian/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Sparky4567/obsidian_ai_plugin.git
cd obsidian_ai_plugin
npm install
open Obsidian app
enable community plugin support
enable LLM plugin
choose a module within the settings tab

```

-   Ensure that you have Ollama installed

```

https://ollama.com/download

```

Read documentation accordingly.

-   Ensure that Ollama model is running in the background

```

ollama run tinyllama

(Example)

```

-   If you downloaded this plugin from GitHub repo, copy it to your .obsidian/plugins, don't forget to run npm install within the plugins directory

```
npm install

```

to install all needed dependencies.

-   Ensure that the plugin is activated
-   Choose the right endpoint and model in plugins settings
-   Write something into editor field (Simple text)
-   Select the text with your mouse
-   Press CTRL+P after selection
-   Type in ASK LLM and choose your wanted command (There aren't many at the moment)
-   Press Enter to confirm
-   Wait for a while to get the result

Your text will be changed with the text from LLM (Default is tinyllama)
